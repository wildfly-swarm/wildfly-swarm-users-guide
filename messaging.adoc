= Messaging

The Messaging fraction brings support for JMS to your application. Currently, the messaging capability does _not_ span across multiple independent WildFly Swarm-based services, but is only available within a single service.

The WildFly Swarm messaging broker is based upon ActiveMQ.

== Configuration

To enable messaging for your application, you need to include the following dependency:

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-messaging</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Additionally, you _must_ configure some destinations for the messaging broker to be useful.  This is done through your `main(...)` function.

[source,java]

container.subsystem(new MessagingFraction()
    .server(
            new MessagingServer()
                    .enableInVMConnector()
                    .topic("my-topic")
                    .queue("my-queue")
    )
);
