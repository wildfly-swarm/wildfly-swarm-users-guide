= Weld (CDI)

The Weld fraction supports CDI (Content & Dependency Injection) which is a handy method for weaving components together.  The primary part of CDI is the `@Inject` annotation.

== Configuration

To use CDI in your application, you need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>weld</artifactId>
</dependency>
