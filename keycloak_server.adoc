= Keycloak Server

Generally intended to be used as a standalone service, the Keycloak Server is a fraction like any other in the WildFly Swarm ecosystem.

== Adding Keycloak Server support

To bring a Keycloak Server to your application, you need the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>keycloak-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is currently no configuration required beyond this. The Keycloak Server will launch with your application, and be available at the `/auth/admin` context path.

== Standalone Keycloak Server

Please see the chapter on <<servers#,Servers>>.
