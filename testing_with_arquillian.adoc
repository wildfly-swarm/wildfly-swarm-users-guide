= Testing with Arquillian

Arquillian is a test-harness from JBoss that facilitates launching applications and executing test code both from outside and within the running application.

Under traditional usage, Arquillian first launches the application server, then deploys an archive created within your unit test to it.  When used with WildFly Swarm, there is obviously no separate _launch the application server_ phase.

Instead, your test-case creates your application, and the Arquillian adapter wraps it with the WildFly Swarm bits and executes the resulting uberjar.

Once it is running, test code may run outside of the uberjar or within it, reporting the test results back to the testing framework.

== Configuring

To use the WildFly Swarm Arquillian adapter, you need to add a two dependencies to your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>arquillian</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>arquillian-junit-container</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Writing a Test

To integrate Arquillian into your test, you need to use the JUnit `@RunWith` annotation and the `Arquillian.class` test-runner:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class MyTest {
  ...
}
----

This integrates the Arquillian lifecycle with the test-case.

Next, you need to specify the deployment that should be wrapped up in the WildFly Swarm mechanism.  This is accomplished by using the `@Deployment` Arquillian annotation on a public static method that returns a ShrinkWrap archive.

[source,java]
----
@Deployment
public static Archive createDeployment() {
  ...
}
----
    
The contents of this method is similar to whatever you would do within your `main(...)` method.  

For instance:

[source,java]
----
@Deployment
public static Archive createDeployment() {
    JAXRSArchive deployment = ShrinkWrap.create( JAXRSArchive.class );
    deployment.addResource( MyResource.class );
    return deployment;
}
----

By default, all methods annotated with `@Test` will run _inside_ the application.  Depending on the functionality you include, you can use annotations such as `@Inject` (if you're using CDI) to inject components into your test-case class.

If you wish to test your application from _outside_ (for instance, with a web client), you can use the `@RunAsClient` annotation on your method.

=== Example with CDI

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class MyTest {
  
    @Inject
    private MyComponent component;
 
    @Test
    public void testMyComponent() {
      // Runs within the application, CDI injects MyComponent
      
      // assert something about this.component
    }
  
    @Deployment
    public static Archive createDeployment() {
      JARArchive archive = ShrinkWrap.create( JARArchive.class );
       
      // ... set up archive ...
      
      return archive;
    }
}
----

=== Example with custom Container configuration

If the swarm container has to be configured (e.g. to configure the DataSource fraction) then this can be done by implementing the ContainerFactory interface.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class MyTest implements ContainerFactory {
    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static Archive createDeployment() {
        JARArchive deployment = ShrinkWrap.create(JARArchive.class);
        // ... set up archive ...
        return deployment;
    }

    @Override
    public Container newContainer(String... args) throws Exception {
        Container container = new Container();
        // ... configure the container ...
        return container;
    }

    @Test
    @RunAsClient
    public void testNothing() {

    }
}
----

=== Passing additional options to the -swarm.jar

The Arquillian container for WildFly Swarm supports the following system properties in addition to those listed in 
the <<getting-started/plugins/maven-plugin#,plugin chapter>>:

[cols=3, options="header"]
|===
|Name 
|Description
|Default

|swarm.build.modules
|':' separated list of paths to module directories to include
|"modules"

|swarm.build.repos
|',' separated list of repo urls to include when resolving dependencies
|

|swarm.export.uberjar
|If true, the test -swarm.jar will be exported to disk to aid debugging
|false
